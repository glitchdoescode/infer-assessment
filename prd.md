Voice agent recording UI with freeze
detection
Pipecat (https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) is an open-source framework for
building AI voice agents. Create a bot using Pipecat; use Deepgram for STT,
Gemini for LLM and Elevenlabs/Cartesia websocket for TTS
Store transcript and recording for a session and show them in a NextJS UI
with turn latencies overlayed on the recording
Simulate a bot freeze (bot not emitting any audio mid conversation). In the
recording UI, detect and show the freeze over the recording
